caching cluster strategy

    -> visible map bounds are sent to backend  
    -> backend sends to frontend markers within visible map bounds
    -> if map moved, old markers are save and new markers are only added preventing flicker (solved).
    -> markers from away from current visible bounds will be deleted outside of bounds, bounds are larger the higher the zoom.
    -> same strategy when zoomed, markers out of bounds will be removed but onces on visible screen and padded boundaries are kept.

Problems approached

-> Map geojson had too many points, reducing effeciency so i used mapshaper to reduced points while still maintaining shape accuracy.
-> using geojson fill reduces effeciency when rendering, so i removed it and only kept borders, I used another tactic for filling selected area.
